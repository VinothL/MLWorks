# End to End Classification ML Model with Prediction Pipeline

Problem Statement: To identify whether the customer will churn or not

Algorithm in the Pipeline: Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, AdaBoost
Evavulation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score and AUC Score

This pipeline covers the basics eda, feature transformation, model training with grid search and cross validation ,best model selection and prediction pipeline.

The code is developed based on the mlprojects repo - https://github.com/krishnaik06/mlproject
